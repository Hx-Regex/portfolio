# HX Portfolio v2

This is a modern, feature-rich portfolio website built with the T3 stack and tRPC. It showcases my professional experience, technical skills, and projects through an interactive and responsive design.

## Development Philosophy

**"Deliver now, optimize later"** - This project prioritizes rapid feature delivery and functionality over perfect code structure. The focus is on getting a working product with all essential features before diving into optimization and refactoring.

> **Important:** A comprehensive refactor is planned as a TODO item after all core features are implemented and the application is fully functional.

## What This Is

- **Modern Portfolio**: A comprehensive showcase of professional experience and skills
- **Interactive Design**: Features animations, hover effects, and dynamic content
